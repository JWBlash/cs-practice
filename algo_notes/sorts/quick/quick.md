# Quick Sort

## Time Complexities:
Best: Ω(n log(n))  
Avg: Θ(n log(n))  
Worst: O(n^2)  

## Space Complexity:
Best: Ω(log(n))  
Worst: O(n)

## Pseudocode:
```
``` 

## Notes:
Quicksort is a Divide & Conquer algorithm.

Quicksort is also known as partition-exchange sort.

When implemented well, Quicksort is can be 2-3 times faster than merge/heapsort.
